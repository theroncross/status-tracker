#Status Tracker

###About

This is a simple front end application for parsing data transfer data into a friendly table format.

You can see a sample of the output at [https://theroncross.github.io/status-tracker](https://theroncross.github.io/status-tracker).

###Development

The app was created using the [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) package.

As it stands, it only pulls in locally stored json data. A fetch call is commented out, and only needs a path to the proper rest api endpoint to pull in outside data.
